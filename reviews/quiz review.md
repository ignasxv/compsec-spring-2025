**Assume Jane wants to send John an encrypted message, which of the following methods would be correct?**  
- [x] Jane uses John's public key to encrypt the message and then sends it to John. John uses John's private key to decrypt the message.  
- [ ] Jane uses John's private key to encrypt the message and then sends it to John. John uses John's private key to decrypt the message.  
- [ ] Jane uses John's private key to encrypt the message and then sends it to John. John uses John's public key to decrypt the message.  
- [ ] Jane uses John's public key to encrypt the message and then sends it to John. John uses John's public key to decrypt the message.

**When using a larger symmetric key size, the following two things tend to happen:**  
- [ ] The message becomes more difficult to decrypt and the time to perform the encryption is shorter.  
- [ ] The message becomes less difficult to decrypt and the time to perform the encryption is shorter.  
- [x] The message becomes more difficult to decrypt and the time to perform the encryption is longer.  
- [ ] The message becomes less difficult to decrypt and the time to perform the encryption is longer.

**Which of the following best describes how a TCP SYN flood attack works?**  
- [ ] By spoofing the destination port number in the packet, a TCP SYN is generated and sent right back to the sender. *(Incorrect Answer)*  
- [x] By spoofing the source IP address, another host sends SYN-ACK packets to a target. *(Correct Answer)*  
- [ ] By spoofing the destination IP address, another host sends SYN-ACK packets to a target.  
- [ ] By spoofing the source port number in the packet, a TCP SYN is generated and sent by the host to itself.
